## Features
- **3D Models**: Pikachu and other objects in the game are represented using GLTF models.
- **Texturing**: High-quality textures are applied to the models to enhance visual appeal.
- **Collision Detection**: Accurate collision detection to ensure realistic interactions between the volleyball, players, and the net.
- **Animation**: Smooth animations for the Pikachu characters, including movements and actions.
- **User Interface**: Intuitive user interface for easy control and navigation.

## Technologies Used
- **WebGL**: The core technology used for rendering 3D graphics in the browser.
- **GLTF**: Used for loading and displaying 3D models.
- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used for game logic and interaction.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library that simplifies WebGL development and helps in creating 3D graphics.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Kim-Min-Hyeok/Computer-Graphics.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Computer-Graphics/WebGL/term_project
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage
Once the project is set up and running, you can start playing the game. Use the following controls:

- **Move**: 1P(RDFG), 2P(Arrow keys)
- **Jump**: 1P(Z), 2P(,)
- **Reset/Start**: Shift/Enter

The objective of the game is to score points by making the volleyball land on the opponent's side of the net.
